- I get the error ``ValueError: Could not find a format to write the
  specified file in mode 'i'``.

    You probably need to install a library required by `imageio` to write to the desired format.
    We refer to the `imageio documentation <https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
    For OpenEXR, follow the instructions `here <https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/format_exr-fi.html#exr-fi>`_.
